Baselight was one of the first digital color correction systems to enter the digital intermediate market and has seen wide acceptance in the motion picture industry. ,NA,yes
2009 (82nd),SCIENTIFIC AND TECHNICAL AWARD (Scientific and Engineering Award),To MARK JASZBERENYI; GYULA PRISKIN and TAMAS PERLAKI for their contributions to the development of the Lustre color correction system; which enables real-time digital manipulation of motion picture imagery during the digital intermediate process. Lustre is a software solution that enables non-linear; real-time digital color grading across an entire feature film; emulating the photochemical color-timing process. ,NA,yes
2009 (82nd),SCIENTIFIC AND TECHNICAL AWARD (Scientific and Engineering Award),To BRAD WALKER; D. SCOTT DEWALD; BILL WERNER and GREG PETTITT for their contributions furthering the design and refinement of the Texas Instruments DLP Projector technology; achieving a level of performance that enabled color-accurate digital intermediate previews of motion pictures. Working in conjunction with the film industry; Texas Instruments created a high-resolution; color-accurate; high-quality digital intermediate projection system that could closely emulate film-based projection in a theatrical environment. ,NA,yes
2009 (82nd),SCIENTIFIC AND TECHNICAL AWARD (Scientific and Engineering Award),To FUJIFILM CORPORATION; RYOJI NISHIMURA; MASAAKI MIKI and YOUICHI HOSOYA for the design and development of Fujicolor ETERNA-RDI digital intermediate film; which was designed exclusively to reproduce motion picture digital masters. The Fujicolor ETERNA-RDI Type 8511/4511 digital intermediate film has thinner emulsion layers with extremely efficient couplers made possible by Super-Nano Cubic Grain Technology. This invention allows improved color sensitivity with the ability to absorb scattered light; providing extremely sharp images. The ETERNA-RDI emulsion technology also achieves less color cross-talk for exacting reproduction. Its expanded latitude and linearity provides superior highlights and shadows in a film stock with exceptional latent image stability. ,NA,yes
2009 (82nd),SCIENTIFIC AND TECHNICAL AWARD (Scientific and Engineering Award),To PAUL DEBEVEC; TIM HAWKINS; JOHN MONOS and DR. MARK SAGAR for the design and engineering of the Light Stage capture devices and the image-based facial rendering system developed for character relighting in motion pictures. The combination of these systems; with their ability to capture high fidelity reflectance data of human subjects; allows for the creation of photorealistic digital faces as they would appear in any lighting condition. ,NA,yes
2009 (82nd),SCIENTIFIC AND TECHNICAL AWARD (Technical Achievement Award),To MARK WOLFORTH and TONY SEDIVY for their contributions to the development of the Truelight real-time 3D look-up table hardware system. Through the use of color management software and hardware; this complete system enables accurate color presentation in the digital intermediate preview process. The Truelight system is widely utilized in digital intermediate production environments around the world. ,NA,yes
2009 (82nd),SCIENTIFIC AND TECHNICAL AWARD (Technical Achievement Award),To DR. KLAUS ANDERLE; CHRISTIAN BAEKER and FRANK BILLASCH for their contributions to the LUTher 3D look-up table hardware device and color management software. The LUTher system was one of the first color look-up table processors to be widely adopted by the pioneering digital intermediate facilities in the industry. This innovation enabled accurate color presentation by facilities that had analyzed projected film output and built 3D look-up tables in order to emulate print film. ,NA,yes
2009 (82nd),SCIENTIFIC AND TECHNICAL AWARD (Technical Achievement Award),To STEVE SULLIVAN; KEVIN WOOLEY; BRETT ALLEN and COLIN DAVIDSON for the development of the Imocap on-set performance capture system. Developed at Industrial Light & Magic and consisting of custom hardware and software; Imocap is an innovative system that successfully addresses the need for on-set; low-impact performance capture. ,NA,yes
2009 (82nd),SCIENTIFIC AND TECHNICAL AWARD (Technical Achievement Award),To HAYDEN LANDIS; KEN McGAUGH and HILMAR KOCH for advancing the technique of ambient occlusion rendering. Ambient occlusion has enabled a new level of realism in synthesized imagery and has become a standard tool for computer graphics lighting in motion pictures. ,NA,yes
