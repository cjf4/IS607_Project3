### Best Motion Picture did not start until 1944.  
### I have separated Best Picture/Best Motion Picture into a different data frame and then joined it by matching Category that it also won. The frequency of Categories that matched the Best Picture is plotted
 
### According to the plot, 55 Best Pictures also won Directing Category
### Only 33 Best Pictures won Film Editing as well

# Load Master File
academy_awards <- read.csv(file = "c:\\607_proj3\\Data_All_MASTER_edit.csv", stringsAsFactors = FALSE)

# Separate Best Picture won into different data frame
best_picture <- academy_awards %>% select(Year, Category, Nominee, Won.) %>%
                filter(Won. == "yes", 
                       Category %in% c("BEST PICTURE", "BEST MOTION PICTURE")) %>%
                arrange(Year)
kable(head(best_picture))

# Select Categories and other columns into different data frame

# Join the data frames based on the Best Pictures won
category_picture_joined <- categories_won %>% inner_join(best_picture, by = "Nominee")

# Find the frequence and percent of each category 
category_freq <- category_picture_joined %>%

                 mutate(percent=round(count/sum(count),digits=2)) %>% arrange(desc(percent))

# How many Best Pictures also won other categories?
sum(category_freq$count)

# Plot it
ggplot(head(category_freq), aes(x=Category.x, y=count)) + geom_bar(stat = "identity")
