<a id="project-description" class="anchor" href="#project-description" aria-hidden="true"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Project Description</h3>

<p> The goal of Project 3 is to determine whether the Best Film Editing category is the best predictor of winning the Best Picture award in the Academy Awards.</p>

<h3>
<a id="approach" class="anchor" href="#approach" aria-hidden="true"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Approach</h3>

<p>Our overall strategy to tackle this project was to break it down into smaller tasks and farm out those tasks among the entire team. This project required a high-degree of collaboration, so we used the slack.com website to facilitate dynamic, real-time collaboration. The Github website was used to store and share code, as well as other project documents.  Both of these resources were used in parallel and proved very effective.</p>

<br>
<h3>
<a id="data-sources-considered" class="anchor" href="#data-sources-considered" aria-hidden="true"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Data Sources Considered</h3>

<p>Initially, these were the three data sources considered:</p>

<ul style="list-style-type:disc">
  <li>Wikipedia</li>
  <li>AwardsDatabase</li>
  <li>CSV file with data up to 2010</li>
</ul>




<p> Nicholas Capofari tried to use <b>Wikipedia</b> to collect the necessary data for the project. 
Wikipedia seemed to provide the data in a good tabular format. Although a good general reference,
accessing this type of information from Wikipedia had many challenges. For example, the level of 
detail we needed spanned multiple pages.
Additionally, we were not able to verify that all the categories would be included in this data source. 
Finally, Wikipedia indicated whether a nominee won the award or not by shading the table cell yellow. 
This meant that extracting text data from the html table would not include the winner.

Due to time constraints, the team explored other options. Nick's code can be accessed below:</p>

<p onclick="getElementById('wiki').style.display = 'none'" align="center">Show Less</p>
</div>


<p>A second option was a .csv file found at <a href="https://www.aggdata.com/awards/oscar">this link</a> that provided complete
nominee and award information through 2010. However, this was insufficient as
we wanted to the data through 2014, not just 2010. </p>



<p>Finally we settled on the official Awards database at <a href="http://awardsdatabase.oscars.org/ampas_awards/BasicSearchInput.jsp">oscars.org</a>. This data won out in the end because it was complete, official, and the web pages
had text character indicators of winners (an asterick). </p>


<br>

<h3>
<a id="obtaining-data" class="anchor" href="#obtaining-data" aria-hidden="true"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Obtaining the Data</h3>


<p>Below, here is code written by Edwige that uses Selenium, a web driver that simplifies sending requests to web servers by letting us simulate
clicking on things via a web browser. This was a option because the oscars.org website's API wasn't documented or particularly clear.</p>

</div>

<p>Now that the text data had been programatically obtained from the web, we could begin to write code that parsed those text files in R, build Data Frames, and store the data in a SQL database.</p>

<p>Professor Catlin advised we adopt a strategy that let different groups of people attack different parts of the problem simultaneously.
To do this, we manually accessed the oscars.org database awards page, ran
a query in the browser, and copy pasted the text into a text file.
</p>

<p>
While this wasn't practical for getting ALL the data, it allowed us to start working on writing code to parse the text while the programmatic
selenium code was written. Chris wrote some raw, procedural code (that broke about every rule of proper code) to
wrangle just the Best Editing awards and build a dataframe. However this provide valuable to provide a rough framework of the steps that needed
to be done to get the data from text to R dtta frame to ultimately a .csv file.</p>

<p>
John took that raw code and made it generalized. His approach was to write anonymous
fuctions and than apply them to vectors. While there still existed one off situations, John's approach made more use of functional programming techniques that
kept the code's behavior easier to predict and more reusable.

<a id="cleaning-up" class="anchor" href="#cleaning-up" aria-hidden="true"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Cleaning up</h4>

<p>John's script solved many of the formatting problems on the initial run through,
but when working with the data we would sometimes notice small quirks that needed to be cleaned up. For instance, some of the nominees had a space after the movie title, and some did not. This would make it so "The Godfather" and "The Godfather " would be recognized as separate films, which is an issue when doing analysis. <a href="https://github.com/mkds/IS607_Project3/blob/gh-pages/Data/project_view_numeric_cleanup.r">Here is an example of some quick code to solve this issue.</a>
</p>

<br>
<h4>
<a id="database" class="anchor" href="#database" aria-hidden="true"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Database</h4>

<p>Jason worked in close collaboration by continually iterating and writing SQL scripts that changed with the most current version of the data (it changed several times)
Once the final data was obtained, Jason wrote the script at <a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/mkds/IS607_Project3/gh-pages/Data/Raw/awards.sql">this link</a> to put the data into the database. Jason
set up a primary key ID field, a category field (the award), a nominee field (the movie nominated), a won field (whether or not the film won the award), and additional info (any other text data included from oscars.org)</p>

<a id="statistical-analysis" class="anchor" href="#statistical-analysis" aria-hidden="true"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Statistical Analysis</h3>

<p> In this section, team members used various statistical techniques to determine whether Best
Film Editing is the best predictor of Best Picture. </p>

<p> <b>Interpreting the Chi Square test by Angus Huang</b> </p>
<p>Calculating chi-Square test to see the if there is any significant difference across the category.
As p-value is less than 0.05 (0.02623 and 0.008 as shown below), we can conclude there is significant difference across the category of best pictures won.</p>

<br>
<p> <b> Interpretation of two sample t-test results by Diego Diaz </b> </p>
<p> The two sample T-Test statistic was used to determine if a Film Editing nomination was a good predictor for winning the Best Picture award. Based on the analysis, we can conlude that Film Editing is a better predictor of winning the Best Picture award when compared to the rest of the categories put together. Comparing the Film Editing sample to the to individual categories, such as Directing, Sound Mixing, etc., did not yield the same results.</p>

<p> This was a challenging project that required the team to collaborate virtually to accomplish a common goal. 
To all of the team members that contributed to this project, <b>MANY THANK YOUS</b> for your efforts and contributions. 
Without them, we would not have accomplished our objective.

<p>We would also like to thank our professor, Andy Caitlin, for his clear instruction on the 
tools and techniques required to accomplish this project. Thank you Andy! </p>

<p>Lastly, the dynamics of this virtual collaboration would not have been possible without using slack.com, Github.com or Rpubs.
We greatly appreciate the efforts of those that created those sites/applications. </p>
